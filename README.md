# Kotlin & Jetpack Compose Learning Repository

Welcome to my Kotlin and Jetpack Compose learning journey!  
This repository documents my progress in learning Android development with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.

## 📱 Projects

### 1. BMI Calculator
My first project is a simple **BMI (Body Mass Index)** calculator app built with Jetpack Compose. This app allows users to:
- Input their height and weight
- Calculate their BMI
- View the result with a category indication (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, etc.)

#### ✅ What I Learned:
- Setting up a Jetpack Compose project
- Creating composable functions
- Managing state in Compose
- Implementing form input and validation
- Working with Compose's Material Design components
- Handling user interactions

### 2. Weather App
My second project is a **Weather Forecast App** built using:
- 🧩 **Jetpack Compose** for UI
- ☁️ **Ktor** for network requests
- 🔌 **Koin** for dependency injection (DI)

This app fetches real-time weather data from an API and displays:
- Current temperature
- Weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy)
- Daily forecast

#### ✅ What I Learned:
- Using **Ktor** to make asynchronous API calls
- Structuring app architecture with clean principles
- Implementing **Koin** for DI in a modular way
- Managing state with `StateFlow` or `ViewModel`
- Error handling and loading UI states

## 🚀 Summary

Each project in this repository represents a learning milestone.  
I aim to build more apps as I continue exploring Kotlin and Compose.
