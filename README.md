# Kotlin & Jetpack Compose Learning Repository

Welcome to my Kotlin and Jetpack Compose learning journey! This repository documents my progress in learning Android development with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.


### Overview
My first project is a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator app built with Jetpack Compose. This app allows users to:
- Input their height and weight
- Calculate their BMI
- View the result with a category indication (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, etc.)

### What I Learned
- Setting up a Jetpack Compose project
- Creating composable functions
- Managing state in Compose
- Implementing form input and validation
- Working with Compose's Material Design components
- Handling user interactions


This project is part of my learning journey. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
